# PitchPerfect

This is my first project in the sequence of courses leading to the iOS Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.

Created an app that records a conversation between friends and plays it back with adjusted rate and pitch to make it sound like a chipmunk, a Darth Vader, echoing or reverb.

The app contains two pages of content: one for recording audio and the other for playing audio through UIKitÔºèAVAudioRecorder, and also uses UINavigationController to navigate between these two scenes programmatically triggered via performSegueWithIdentifier().

UI elements (labels, buttons and text) are appropriately positioned on the screen for iPhone and iPad portraits and landscape layouts, shown or hidden as appropriate.
